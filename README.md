# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4e - Lords of Naggaroth Homebrew

An adaptation of the [Lords of Naggaroth](docs/Lords of Naggaroth 1.2.3.pdf) homebrew (by _"Naggaroth Anon"_), for Foundry VTT.

Works best when paired with the [Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e-core) module.

With all the content available, the module will seamlessly integrate into the existing [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e/) system "Character Creation" tool.

Additionally, an alternate "Naggaroth" theme is available in the module's settings.
