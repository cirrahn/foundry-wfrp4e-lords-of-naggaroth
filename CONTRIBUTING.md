### Initializer Flags

Some documents in the included packs (those in the [journal-entries](module%2Fpacks%2Fjournal-entries) and [tables](module%2Fpacks%2Ftables) packs) have custom flags set to ensure they appear in the correct folder hierarchy when brought in using the Initializer.

Currently, these flags can be set using the [update-active-app-init-flags](script%2Fupdate-active-app-init-flags.js) script.

Note that, for a document, these flags **reset** when a document is edited via the in-Foundry UI.
