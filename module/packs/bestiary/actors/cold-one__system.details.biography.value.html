<section class="secret" id="secret-KIuSaqdYLAaNIrKq"><p>Cold Ones are an ancient race of green-skinned reptiles that live in the dark caves and tunnels in the mountains underneath Hag Graef. Their cold flesh is almost immune to pain and their bodies exude a toxic slime. Dark Elves can withstand small quantities of this slime and tiny amounts are used to make the poisons and intoxicating brews used by the Asssassins and Witch Elves of Khaine. Though single-minded when hunting and feeding, Cold Ones are extremely stubborn beasts, and not at all intelligent. It takes great strength, practice and willpower to master such a steed, and those Dark Elves that do so earn fear, if not respect from their fellow Naggarothi nobles. In the Old World Cold Ones are exceptionally rare, existing only in a few rare menageries and the fabulous Imperial Zoo of Altdorf. However, a few Beastmasters associated with the Covenant of Nethu have managed to import a handful of breeding pairs for their own purposes and they may be convinced to sell them to enterprising Druchii in the Old World.</p></section>
