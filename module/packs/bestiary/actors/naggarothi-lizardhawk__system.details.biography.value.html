<section class="secret" id="secret-ggdcIO8jf0t0zNEh"><p>A common pet in Druchii society, favoured for its vicious nature and loyalty to its master. The Lizard-hawk looks much like a raptor sized dragon, though it lacks the forearms like the Wyverns, which has led some scholars to speculate it is an offshoot of this very same breed of creature. Typically trained and kept as hunting birds, much like Old World falconry, Lizard-hawks have a myriad of common breeds, such as the Parrot Lizard-hawk with its ability to mimic speech making it highly popular among Druchii corsairs, or the ‘Drakeling’ bred for its size and venom and often used to track and chase down runaway slaves. In the Old World they are often imported by exotic animal traders and adventurers. A notable part of the Covenant of Nethus legal income in the Old World come from selling these animals to nobles and rich burghers who wish to show off their worldliness.</p></section>
