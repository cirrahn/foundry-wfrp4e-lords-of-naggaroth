<p>While not a weapon, the tough scales of the Sea Dragon Cloak are used by Druchii Corsairs to ward off blows and shots from the myriad of foes they encounter in their raids across the world. Indeed, many Corsairs even use their Sea Dragon Cloaks much like Estalian Diestros use cloaks like a flexible shield in their fencing arts, though of course they claim they invented the style. Sea Dragon Cloaks are rare to find in the Old World, particularly undamaged examples, as Corsairs are not particularly fond of parting with them. When not used as a Shield, the Sea Dragon Cloak provides +1 AP to all locations but the Head.</p>
