	<em>The ninety-nine sacred killing strikes are secret ways of killing jealously guarded by Khaines devoted, but with dark dedications chanted to the Lord of Murder this holy knowledge can be passed to those carrying His blessing.</em>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Dagger that has been used to murder.</p>
<p>Invoking the Lord of Murder to bless His agent with one of the ninety-nine sacred killing strikes, you touch the edge of a dagger used in murder to the bare skin of your target, granting them Khaines blessing. For the duration of the spell, the target will gain an additional Resilience point to use only for <strong>I Will Not Fail!</strong> in tests made to Attack a target. If it is not used within the duration of the spell, the Resilience point is lost.</p>
