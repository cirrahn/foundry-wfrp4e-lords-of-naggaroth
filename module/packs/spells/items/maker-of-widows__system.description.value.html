	<em>The cursed Widowmaker taints the souls of the Druchii and with enough blood and souls sacrificed to Kaela Mensha Khaine, the Bloody Handed God, He can grant a portion of its cursed power upon His worshippers.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Sacrificial victim(s).</p>
<p>In a great and (un)holy ritual of blood and death you cut out the hearts of sacrificial victims and offer their souls to Kaela Mensha Khaine to grant you and the assembled worshippers a portion of the murderous frenzy bound in the Widowmaker. For each victim used as sacrifice the caster gains a +10 bonus to their <strong>Channeling (Khainite Sorcery) test</strong>. The first victim sacrificed grants a number of targets equal to your Willpower Bonus x2 Frenzy and Fear (1) for the duration of the spell. For each additional victim sacrificed as part of the casting of the spell, increase the multiplier for the number of affected targets by 1 and the rating of the Fear trait by 1. You can only sacrifice up to your Willpower Bonus in victims to increase the Channeling (Khainite Sorcery) test bonus, number of affected targets, Fear rating and duration, any further sacrifices will give no mechanical advantage but will be pleasing to Khaine.</p>
