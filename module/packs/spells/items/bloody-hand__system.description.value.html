	<em>You chant your dark dedications to the Lord of Murder and your hands begin to drip blood, marking you as Khaine’s chosen.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: A murdered man’s blood.</p>
<p>Your hands drip with the blood of the murdered, splashing on your foes in combat. Any that wish to charge you must first succeed on a <strong>Cool test</strong> or suffer a Broken condition as they stare at the blood in horror. Furthermore, those in combat with you suffer a -10 penalty to Weapon skill and Agility tests as they instinctually try to avoid the terrible ichor.</p>
